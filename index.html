			<h1>"What is Poetic about Computation?"</h1>
			<h3>By Taeyoon Choi</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Subject:</strong> This chapter discusses how code is just one aspect of computation and how it holds aesthetic value and is considered a form of poetry.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Context:</strong> Taeyoon Choi wrote this in 2017. The book is based off some of his lectures at the School for Poetic Computation, where he is the co-founder. The reading goes in depth about the origin of the first computer and different types of computers.
					<ul>
						<li>First computers were <strong> humans </strong></li>
						<li><strong>Mechanical computer:</strong> could calculate large sets of data and was a system of moving gears</li>
						<li><strong>Analog computer: </strong>used a continuous electrical signal and used a disc and wheel mechanism </li>
						<li><strong>Electronic computer: </strong> used electrical currents to carry out more complex logic</li>
					</ul>
					Choi was intrigued by the fact that computers essentially only use 0s and 1s to carry out all functions. He then made a computer from scratch and showed how it really is an art form.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Observation:</strong> I find it kind of crazy how new computers are, considering the first computer was invented in the mid 1900s, and how quickly they have advanced to what they are today. </li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Question:</strong> The reading briefly touched on the topic of computing and ethics. What is considered ethical and unethical when it comes to computing?</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Lesson: </strong>I had never though about coding in this sense and had never considered the actual syntax and written aspect a form of art. </li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Connection: </strong> This reading reminded me about the first project we did in which we made different typographic layouts for a poem. While the text was obviously poetic, so was the code. Most of us used a lot of spaces "&nbsp" and line breaks, and the repition of these in the code could be interpreted as poetic.</li>
